# SOSGame
Welcome to the SOS Game! This is a simple console-based game where two players take turns to place either 'S' or 'O' letters on a 4x4 grid. The objective of the game is to create the "SOS" pattern either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Each time a player forms the "SOS" pattern, they score a point and get another turn. The game ends when the entire grid is filled, and the player with the highest score wins.

## Rules and Conditions
- Players can only input 'S' or 'O' letters.
- The grid is a 4x4 square.
- "SOS" patterns can be formed horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- Each time a player forms an "SOS" pattern, they score a point and get another turn.
- The game ends when the entire grid is filled.
- The player with the highest score wins. If both players have the same score, it's a tie.
